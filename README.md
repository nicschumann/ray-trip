# Ray Trip

## Values, Rules, and Constraints

On 3/12/2021, Cem Eskinazi and I met up to talk about a web project to compliment and accompany his forthcoming typeface, "Ray" (name to change). I'd spent the previous month or so messing around with an [interactive fluid simulator](https://github.com/nicschumann/fairly-fast-fluids) based on the energy and disposition of the typeface design â€“ But we'd both independently arrived at a the conclusion that we wanted something more narrative.

This website is a platform for bringing the reader on a journey through our experiences making and communicating "Ray".
