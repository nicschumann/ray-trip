  text: `It must have been the nonchalant aura of the day. *1500 When I'm in the mood, *350 I tend to steer away from my usual route. *1500 Some might call it wandering, *450 some might call it meditation. *1500 For me, *350 it is processing, *350 digestion and recalibration. *1500 I let my legs guide me. *1500 I find it rewarding to end up on a random corner of the park. *1500 I'm pretty familiar with this place: *450 the oaks and the birches, *350 the occasional bushes waiting to scratch your legs or tear your pants. *1500 Or at least, *250 I thought I was *250 until I found myself staring at the [adj] mushroom.`,
