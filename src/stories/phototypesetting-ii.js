  text: `The constraints of setting metal type were blurred after the invention of phototypesetting. Designers were able to print type on sizes that fell out of the defaults. Distortion of letters or words through projecting letters on an angle or mapping the projections on warped geometries soon became the fingerprint of this format. But one thing always amazes me about phototypesetting. When light is shined on paper, it is not always as clear where the black stops and the white begins. In the end you produce letters that are warm and soft.`,
