  text: `Actually, that’s not quite true. *1500 The roots are deep, *350 but I can take you there… *500 I have a long crit day ahead with my students. *1500 As I enter the classroom, *350 I am greeted with over-caffeinated eyes *350 still resisting the urge to crash after 12-plus hours of graphic design homework. *1500 The curriculum here is brutal, *350 and the culture is  unhealthy. *1500 Still, *350 I love being here, *350 simply because I can watch the world from inside the classroom *250 through weekly assignments. *1500 Every deliverable is a portal opening up on a slice of culture, *350 on a good day *350 a deliberate critique, *350 on other days *350 a reflection of their desires.`,
