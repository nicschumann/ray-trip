  text: `I collapse on my back and rest my head against a descending old-style figure. Diamond shaped rounds watch me as I struggle to find the light in between them. The room is skewed and the remaining members of the family leak between the walls. I catch a glimpse of a control character waving its entry and exit strokes at me as fast as possible. My eyes adjust to the angle of the load-bearing capitals and my editor absorbs the italics. In the spinning room, I rush to close the remaining contours, one by one, counter-clock wise for darks and clock-wise for lights. My body decomposes in between the lines of type as the leading tightens. Attempting to take one last peek, I fail to find myself in the room.`,
