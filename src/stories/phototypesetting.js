  text: `The photograph—a result of light rays exciting the photosensitive cyristals glued on to paper in order to freeze time—itself needs to be frozen in time through protecing it from the very rays of light responsible of its development. Alphabets also freeze time, not through capturing light but through capturing sound. They also freeze thought and logic and math and poetry and the letter to my accountant. Historically, both photographs and alphabets are captured in flipped forms as they mirror light, sound and thought. There is also phototypesetting which marries the photograph and the alphabet. Light is shined through stencils on to photosensitive paper. It’s basically screen printing inside a camera. How fucking cool is that?`,
