  text: `Sometimes, after the students leave, I like to spend time with the empty pin boards. The punctured surfaces remind me of an inverted universe: black stars on a white sky. These borads carry the memory of the instution, the trace of every project that was ever posted in that classroom. Every crit, every broken heart, every class day after a sleepless night is stabbed into these walls... I just took that bite, because today, I finally saw the edge of this universe. I took that bite because maybe, there is something more beyond these empty pin boards.`,
