  text: `I set some type and send it over to the printer. The room bends to a 15º angle as I watch proofs spill out. The type burns on to paper as I struggle to see where the black stops and the white begins. I collapse on my back and rest my head against a soft and warm glyph—one that I know no one will ever type. My eyes adjust to the angle of the load-bearing capitals and I check the forced spacing between the diamond rounds. In the spinning room, I rush to close the remaining contours, one by one, counter-clock wise for darks and clock-wise for lights. My body leaks in between the negatives. And the aperture tightens. Attempting to take one last peek, I fail to find myself in the room.`,
