Screens with ever shrinking pixels displayed type with long, aggressive serifs nailing their sound into my memory as I was scanning the room. It was a fair mirror image of the dystopian narratives the news shove down our throats lately. And the students, being hypersenstive to all of it, captured it perfectly.`,
