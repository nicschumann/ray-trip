# Todo List

## Typesetting

- [ ] **Link Styles**

## Content

- [ ] **Favicon**
- [ ] **Expand / complete specimen frames**
- [ ] **Copyedit all quotemarks / punctuation / typographic marks**
- [ ] Add links to relevant websites.
- [ ] Consider: Intertitle content
  - [x] Consider the "tapestry" style.
  - [ ] **Design Act I / Act II intertitle.**
  - [x] Add a *The End* slide after `mantar` to show that the story is over, and we're transitioning to a new space.
- [ ] Create second draft of story / edit all story frames

## Development

- [ ] **Design Mobile Interactions that work on iPhone.**
- [ ] Fix placement of asterism so its centered; update text of `specimen-i`.
- [ ] The story data is really big, and takes too long to load. Add an "initial story" into the script, and then load `stories.js` asynchronously. `paths.js`, too.
- [ ] Check for horizontal scroll.

## Animation

- [ ] Decide how to do animations, if at all.
  - [ ] lean into timing? (Cem did a pass)
  - [ ] push into snow effect / prototype it?

## Pre-Launch

- [ ] **Build font page for occ website upload.**
- [ ] **Do domain redirects w/ Marie (mantar.occupantfonts.com)**
- [x] Review QA Jill Notes.
  - [ ] TN Form for the website.
  - [ ] Package and send to TN.
  - [ ] update fonts on site (if needed).
- [ ] Develop instagram posts (video + caption)
  - [ ] plan instagram rollout strategy and timeline
  - [ ] develop content for posts
  - [ ] screen-record posts
- [ ] Write Mantar Design Notes article (for occupantfonts.com).
- [ ] Have a recorded conversation about the website project (to scaffold an article for occupantfonts.com on the project).
