# Todo List

## Typesetting

- [ ] Typesetting for main story (desktop & mobile)
- [ ] Typesetting for centered specimen text (desktop & mobile)
- [ ] Typesetting for Large Words
- [ ] typesetting for end frames
- [ ] manual "kerning" for `$trim`'ed colored punct.
- [x] debug negative sidebearings (f italic, for example) getting clipped on Safari.
- [ ] ~Think about Georgia / how to differentiate it? Maybe not?~


## Content

- [x] Create 3 more large word layouts
- [x] Create 3 more large language layouts
- [x] Create 3 more large story specimen layouts
- [ ] Specimen ordering
- [x] Finish story ending frames
- [ ] **Create second draft of story / edit all story frames**
- [ ] Copyedit specimen frames
- [ ] Copyedit all quotemarks / punctuation / typographic marks
- [ ] **Act I / Act II intertitle content**

## Animation

- [ ] Decide how to do animations, if at all.
  - [ ] lean into timing?
  - [ ] push into snow effect / prototype it?
- [x] Modify the up transition so that the duration depends on the length of the text.

## Development

- [ ] **Design Mobile Interactions that work on iPhone.**
- [ ] **Debug type on Mobile.**
- [x] Test out specimen icon as centered text.
- [ ] The story data is really big, and takes too long to load. Add an "initial story" into the script, and then load `stories.js` asynchronously. `paths.js`, too.
