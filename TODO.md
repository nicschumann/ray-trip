# Todo List

## Typesetting

- [ ] **Typesetting for main story (desktop & mobile)**
- [ ] **Typesetting for centered specimen text (desktop & mobile)**
- [ ] **Typesetting for Large Words**
- [ ] **Typesetting for end frames**
- [x] debug negative sidebearings (f italic, for example) getting clipped on Safari.
- [ ] ~manual "kerning" for `$trim`'ed colored punct.~
- [ ] ~Think about Georgia / how to differentiate it? Maybe not?~

## Content

- [ ] **Specimen ordering**
- [ ] **Generate a proof-reading document or protocol somehow...**
- [ ] **Deploy site, send link to friends.**
- [ ] Act I / Act II intertitle content
  - [ ] Consider the "tapestry" style.
  - [ ] Consider using Glyph Snow animation.
- [ ] Add a *The End* slide after `mantar` to show that the story is over, and we're transitioning to a new space.
- [ ] Create second draft of story / edit all story frames
- [ ] Copyedit specimen frames
- [ ] Copyedit all quotemarks / punctuation / typographic marks
- [ ] Consider adding more intertitles (Act I, Act II, The End, ...) if needed.
- [ ] Favicon
- [x] Create 3 more large word layouts
- [x] Create 3 more large language layouts
- [x] Create 3 more large story specimen layouts
- [x] Finish story ending frames

## animation

- [ ] **Decide how to do animations, if at all.**
  - [ ] lean into timing? (Cem did a pass)
  - [ ] **push into snow effect / prototype it?**
- [ ] `prelude-ii` timeout help.
- [x] Modify the up transition so that the duration depends on the length of the text.

## Development

- [ ] **Add command to support proper linebreaking for tapestry pages, if needed.**
- [ ] Design Mobile Interactions that work on iPhone.
- [ ] Debug type on Mobile.
- [ ] The story data is really big, and takes too long to load. Add an "initial story" into the script, and then load `stories.js` asynchronously. `paths.js`, too.
- [x] Test out specimen icon as centered text.

## Pre-Launch

- [ ] Review QA Jill Notes and update fonts on site (if needed).
- [ ] Develop instagram posts (video + caption)
- [ ] Build font page for occ website upload.
- [ ] Do domain redirects w/ Marie (mantar.occupantfonts.com)
- [ ] Write Mantar Design Notes article (for occupantfonts.com).
- [ ] Have a recorded conversation about the website project (to scaffold an article for occupantfonts.com on the project).
