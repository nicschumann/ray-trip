# Todo List

*done.*

## Content


- [ ] Copyedit all quotemarks / punctuation / typographic marks
- [ ] Review links to relevant websites.
- [ ] Edit all story frames

## Development

- [ ] [Not sure if this is a real issue?] The story data is really big, and takes too long to load. Add an "initial story" into the script, and then load `stories.js` asynchronously. `paths.js`, too.
